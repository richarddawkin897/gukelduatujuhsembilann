    <p><strong>23+ Projected First Round Fantasy Football PNG</strong>. Looking at this year&#039;s first round fantasy picks, there are no surprises since each has produced so well in the past that we can see a similar scenario playing out in 2019.

                If you read my recent fantasy football blueprint here at bleacher report, then you know i&#039;m a proponent of waiting to draft a fantasy quarterback. Much like the first round, round 2 of the drafts i have participated in (be they mock or otherwise) has been relatively predictable. Stick with a running back as your first priority, and then a wide receiver here.
